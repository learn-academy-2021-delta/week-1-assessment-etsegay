  Researched answer:Pair programming is an important technique for developing  quality code, faster while also reducing risk and spreading knowledge in an organization. In pair programming, two software developers  can work on one computer, collaborating on the same design and data structure.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:We did a lot helpful tasks last week,for me the most exciting portion was github and pair programming.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration:Iteration is number of excution of a code in a loop

2. Higher Order Functions:functions that accept function as parameters or return functions (e.g map(),filter(),reduce(),sort())

3. Jest:Jest is one type of software testing that uses three methods( describe,test or it and expect)

4. Objects:

5. Classes: classes are blue-print to factor objects in javascript.It is easier to create large number of objects from class rather than using object literals and constructor functions.
